# SelfCleaner
The primary goal of the robot is to navigate and clean a given area without human intervention, mimicking the functionality of a Roomba. By employing a cleaning mechanism, a brush in this scenario, the robot is designed to remove dust, dirt, and debris efficiently from a variety of surfaces. The robot uses a sensor to identify and navigate around obstacles, preventing collisions and ensuring smooth operation in cluttered environments. Designed to be simple to use, the robot operates independently once powered on, requiring minimal user input or supervision. The robot comes equipped with an LCD screen that outputs the total amount of time spent cleaning.
